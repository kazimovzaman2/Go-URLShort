# Go-URLShort

The goal of this project is to create an http. The handler will look at the path of any incoming web request and determine if it should redirect the user to a new page, much like a URL shortener would.

For instance, if we have a redirect setup for /dogs to https://www.somesite.com/a-story-about-dogs we would look for any incoming web requests with the path /dogs and redirect them.
